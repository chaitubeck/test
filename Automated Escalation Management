# 📘 **Accredo Lens – Automated Escalation Management (AI-Driven Workflow Integration)**

### *Replacing Manual CRM Steps With Embedded Intelligence*

---

## 📌 **Overview**

The Escalation Management Workflow in Credo/Accredo currently involves multiple **manual user actions** performed by CSRs, pharmacists, and designees within our CRM system. These actions include assessing hold reasons, selecting escalation types, documenting notes, creating FLO cases, validating release rules, and routing to internal queues.

With **MyAccredoLens** and our **Order Agent**, we can now automate nearly all of these human steps using **embedded AI + API orchestration** for both **patient and prescriber personas**.

This document outlines:

1. What the current human actions are
2. How Accredo Lens replaces each action
3. Proposed end-to-end AI-driven escalation flow
4. Architecture alignment with our enterprise AI strategy

---

## 🎯 **Goals**

* **Reduce manual CRM workload**
* **Lower SLA misses** through proactive escalation
* **Improve order turnaround time** for patients
* **Provide prescribers real-time decisioning**
* **Eliminate errors and inconsistent case routing**
* **Enable fully automated escalation triggers**

# 🧩 **1. Current Human Actions in Escalation Workflow**

The table below consolidates **all manual steps** employees perform today inside Credo’s escalation tool.

### **Table: Current Manual CRM User Actions**

| Step | Human Action                                 | Who Performs It |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| 1    | Open Order Status                            | CSR / Agent     |
| 2    | Read the Hold Reason                         | CSR / Agent     |
| 3    | Click “Escalate” or “Request MID”            | CSR             |
| 4    | Tick verification checkboxes                 | CSR             |
| 5    | Select an escalation reason from dropdown    | CSR             |
| 6    | Type escalation note                         | CSR             |
| 7    | Submit escalation request                    | CSR             |
| 8    | Click “Release from Hold”                    | CSR / Designee  |
| 9    | Work escalation case (review, update, route) | FLO / Designee  |
| 10   | Perform clinical review, approve/deny        | Pharmacist      |

These actions represent significant **manual cognitive load**, depend on **tribal knowledge**, and create **inconsistencies** in routing and SLA adherence.

# 🤖 **2. How Accredo Lens Automates Each Human Step**

Accredo Lens integrates our **Order Agent**, **RAG orchestration**, and **credoservices APIs** to replace every human action programmatically.

### **Table: Human Action → AI/Order Agent Automation**

| Manual Step              | AI Replacement                                  | Notes                                       |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Open Order Status        | Order Agent fetches order, hold, SLA metadata   | Triggered by patient/prescriber interaction |
| Read Hold Reason         | Agent interprets hold + PA + DV + ENC data      | Summaries shown to user conversationally    |
| Click Escalate           | Agent auto-evaluates if escalation is allowed   | Follows exact business rules                |
| Tick checkboxes          | Agent verifies required checks using APIs       | No human confirmation needed                |
| Select escalation reason | Agent chooses correct reason based on rules     | Zero manual decisioning                     |
| Add a note               | Agent generates structured escalation note      | Captures context + patient intent           |
| Submit escalation        | Agent performs FLO case creation via API        | No UI interaction                           |
| Release from Hold        | Agent checks release rules, executes release    | Prevents invalid releases                   |
| Work escalation case     | Agent routes case to correct queue              | No inconsistent routing                     |
| Pharmacist review        | Agent flags when pharmacist review is mandatory | Optional: notify clinical queue             |

# 🧠 **3. New End-to-End AI-Driven Escalation Flow**

Below is the *new* workflow when a **patient or prescriber** interacts with Accredo Lens.

---

## **🔹 Step 1 — User Asks a Question or Requests an Update**

Examples:

* “Why is my order on hold?”
* “Can you expedite my order?”
* “What is the status?”
* “Can you release it?”

The Order Agent interprets the intent.

---

## **🔹 Step 2 — Order Agent Automatically Evaluates:**

* Hold type
* SLA bucket
* PA or DV dependencies
* Required documentation
* Safety or clinical flags
* Whether escalation is allowed

---

## **🔹 Step 3 — If Escalation is Needed:**

The Agent performs all the previously manual actions:

* Validates business rules
* Chooses escalation reason
* Writes structured escalation note
* Creates/updates FLO case
* Routes to correct internal team
* Updates SLA priority
* Logs the event

**No CSR interaction required.**

---

## **🔹 Step 4 — If Release Is Allowed:**

The Agent:

* Performs release eligibility checks
* Initiates API-based release
* Confirms release to patient/prescriber
* Updates the case
* Re-routes appropriately

---

## **🔹 Step 5 — Provide Real-Time Explanation to User**

Accredo Lens explains:

* Why escalation was triggered
* What steps were completed
* What internal team is reviewing it
* Expected timeline
* What the user needs to do next

---

# 🏗️ **4. Updated Architecture (AI-Powered Escalation Layer)**

### **Components:**

* **Order Agent (LLM)**
* **Multi-Agent Orchestration Layer (Order, PA, DV, Case Agents)**
* **Credo RAG Knowledge Layer**
* **Backend APIs (Order, PA, Encounters, Escalation API)**
* **Lens Chat Interface (Patient, Prescriber Personas)**
* **Audit + Compliance Logging**

### **Flow:**

```
User → Accredo Lens → Order Agent → RAG + APIs → 
Escalation Decision Engine → FLO Case + Routing → Response to User
```

This aligns with our 2025–2026 EIA roadmap for **Embedded Intelligence**.
